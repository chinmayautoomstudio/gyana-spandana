## Implementation Notes

1. **Text Overlay:** All images will have a dark overlay (40% black opacity) for text readability
2. **Branding:** Logo and "Gyana Spandana" text will be overlaid in top-left
3. **Marketing Text:** Title and description will be overlaid in bottom-left
4. **Navigation Dots:** Will be positioned at the bottom center
5. **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 landscape (1920x1080px or higher)
6. **File Size:** Optimize for web (under 500KB recommended after compression)

Ensure images work well with these overlays and maintain visual appeal while being photorealistic and culturally appropriate.
